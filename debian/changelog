ros-melodic-velodyne-pointcloud (1.5.0-0stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * Merge pull request #164 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/164> from ros-drivers/maint/vlp_32c_support
    Adding VLP-32C support.
    This was tested by AutonomouStuff and several external users. Though it does not include new information that I've learned (it appears that the distance resolution is different <50m vs >=50m), it is a good start.
  * Merge pull request #189 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/189> from kveretennicov/patch-1
  * Fix malformed plugin description XML
    ROS pluginlib only recognizes multiple <library> elements if they are under
    <class_libraries> XML root. It silently ignores malformed XMLs with multiple
    <library> "root"s and just reads the first one, due to relaxed way tinyxml2 does
    parsing. Though if you do rosrun nodelet declared_nodelets, the issue is
    reported properly.
    See also similar issue in https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl/issues/131
  * Adding distance_resolution to test yaml files.
  * Adding VLP-32C support.
    Based on work done by @rockcdr. Adds distance_resolution calibration
    value to support 0.004m distance resolution for VLP-32C.

    Bugfix issue #174 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/174>
  * Merge pull request #177 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/177> from C-NR/feature/WrapPointcloudData
    Feature/wrap pointcloud data
  * Changes fixing deadlock for specific cut_angle values.
  * moved definition of VPoint and VPointCloud back to namespace rawdata in rawdata.h
  * put a wrapper around pointcloud data including a generic setter method to enable the use of arbitrary data structures  (pcl pointcloud, depth image, octomaps and so on) to be filled by just using RawData::unpack method with the wrapper object as parameter
  * Merge pull request #170 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/170> from ros-drivers/maint/move_header_files
    Moving header files to traditional location inside include folders.
  * Merge pull request #160 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/160> from ros-drivers/maint/updating_package_xml_to_v2
  * Updated all package.xmls to ver 2. Cleaned up catkin_lint errors.
    All package.xml files are now compatible with version 2 of the
    package.xml specification in REP 140. Removed some unnecessary
    execute permissions on a few files. Fixed a missing test_depend.
  * Merge pull request #136 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/136> from stsundermann/patch-1
    Use std::abs instead of abs
  * Adding missing 32C configuration file.
  * Merge pull request #139 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/139> from ASDeveloper00/vlp32
    Adding support for VLP-32C.
  * Merge pull request #138 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/138> from volkandre/cut_at_specified_angle_feature
    Cut at specified angle feature
  * Updated default cut_angle parameters in launch files after switching from deg to rad.
  * Use std::abs instead of abs
    abs is the c version which returns an integer. This is probably not intended here, so use the templated std::abs function.

    DISTANCE_MAX and DISTANCE_MAX_UNITS are not used anywhere in the code.

  * calibration: make max_intensity and min_intensity optional (#84 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/84>)
    This fixes a regression in the 32e and VLP-16 calibrations which do not contain
    intensity values. There is still a problem with the 64e_s2.1 calibration.

  * allow horiz_offset_correction to be optional with 0 as default
  * allow floats instead of ints in min/max_intensity
  * Resolve frame ID name using tf prefix.
  * Improve coding style.
  * Set up dynamic reconfiguration for transform_node.
    Previously, transform_node has neither read parameters other than frame_id from the command line nor has it exposed these parameters via dynamic reconfigure. As parameters like max_range and view_width have been initialized to zero, the inconfigurable transform_node has returned an empty point cloud.
    Now, transform_node launches an reconfigure server just as cloud_node. In contrast to cloud_node, transform node exposes another parameter for dynamic reconfiguration: frame_id, i.e. the frame of reference the incoming Velodyne points are transformed to.

  * Fixed azimuth overflow bug.
    For interpolated azimuth values between 35999.5 and 36000.0 the nested round(fmod())
    yields a value of 36000 which is invalid and overflows the pre-computed sin/cos arrays,
    since they only go form 0..35999
