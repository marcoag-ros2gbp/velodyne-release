    Bugfix issue #174 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/174>
  * Removed debug outputs
  * Changes fixing deadlock for specific cut_angle values.
  * Merge pull request #135 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/135> from cfneuhaus/bugfix
    Bugfix: when no device ip is set, we still want to filter by udp port.
  * Merge pull request #170 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/170> from ros-drivers/maint/move_header_files
    Moving header files to traditional location inside include folders.
  * Merge pull request #160 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/160> from ros-drivers/maint/updating_package_xml_to_v2
  * Updated all package.xmls to ver 2. Cleaned up catkin_lint errors.
    All package.xml files are now compatible with version 2 of the
    package.xml specification in REP 140. Removed some unnecessary
    execute permissions on a few files. Fixed a missing test_depend.
  * Merge pull request #151 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/151> from Axel13fr/feature/No_Communication_Diag_Update
  * Fix packet rate for the Velodyne 32C
  * Conventions: adding name for unused method parameter.
  * Added a periodic update of the diagnostics so that when no data is received at all from the Velodyne, a diagnostic information will be published. The previous implementation would publish diagnostics only on packet reception.
